VKLoader
========
This is a project I made in a couple of hours, since I found a Wallpaper Collection hosted at VK, and saw no _Download_ button anywhere.

The code is sluggish, and you'll find I've made horrible use of _if-else_ statements. It's got a bit of OOP and I should probably refactor everything so it is more clean.

**It currently downloads everything to the location wich the executable is located in. Say C:/Pictures/VKLoader.exe then all pictures will be downloaded there.**

Instructions
------------

1. Pass in a [valid VK Album url](http://vk.com/album-22382023_240601069)
2. Profit!
